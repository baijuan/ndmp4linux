The idea I have for this project to to create a server application for Linux which allows NDMP capable backup servers to connect to a Linux host and backup data. Ideally, the implementation will allow for integration with LVM2 for creating and releasing snapshots before/after the backup begins/ends. It should also integrate with the Linux VFS to sync all information to disk to ensure a consistent environment for backups.

=Implementation Notes=
    A quick read through the NDMP API docs has shown me that in relation to LVM integration, there are 2 functions which will interest us most.
  # \ModuleStartFunc - Indicates to the server that a backup operation is beginning
  # \NdmpdDoneFunc - Indicates to the server that a backup operation is finished

    It is my opinion that the ModuleStartFunc should be extended to add the following capabilities:
  # Make a call to the Linux VFS to sync all disks
  # Create a new snapshot via LVM2
  # Mount the snapshot to a directory name defined in the server configuration file

    Furthermore, the NdmpDoneFunc should be extended to perform the following operations:
  # Unmount the snapshot from the filesystem
  # Release the snapshot from the LVM2 mapper


    Beyond the LVM2 integration, we should provide support for integrating arbitrary application plugin APIs for things like PostgreSQL, MySQL, HSQLDB, etc.... This would allow the NDMP server to be a fully functional and flexible Linux backup agent on par with agents available for other operating systems and applications. The plugins would extend/override the Read/Seek functions and allow access to application data using native APIs for the given application.
